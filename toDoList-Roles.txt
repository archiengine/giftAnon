Jarrod - 
Create functionality for the 3 Gift List by (City, Facility, Category) pages
    Gift button in the actions column will assign the session['id'] as the "purchaser_id" in the db. Anything that has a purchaser_id other than null will not appear in any of these lists. The purchaser_id purchases will only appear in that session['id']s appropriate "Gift Given" page if the session and purchases_id match.
Write logic for Gift Given and My Gift Requests pages
    Admins cannot view Gifts Given
    Users cannot view My Gift Requests (They also shouldn't be able to see their opposing buttons for these pages. Users can't see "My Gift Requests" buttons, etc.)
